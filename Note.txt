

We split the work in a way that both of us contributed in a complementary and fairly equal way.

For the presentation, Alireza was responsible for Part One – the conceptual framework and model families.
He gathered the material, created the slides, and presented that part. Abhishek handled Part Two, which focused on macroeconomic PD modeling.
He collected the references, prepared the slides for his section, and presented that part as well.

For the analysis, Alireza developed the full Python pipeline from scratch — including data gathering, AR(1) modeling, simulation, and forecasting.
Abhishek contributed by refining the analysis, aligning it with the structure of the reference paper, and reviewing the overall code quality to make it presentation-ready.
So while Alireza focused more on the implementation, Abhishek made sure it matched the academic direction and presentation needs.

As for the seminar paper, Alireza wrote the first complete draft.
Abhishek then revised and improved parts of the text for clarity, structure, and alignment with the empirical results.
The final paper reflects the joint effort of both contributors, each supporting the other’s part to reach a coherent result.

A quick note from Alireza:

When I initially began running the analysis code, I encountered compatibility issues between certain packages under Python 3.13.
To resolve this, I downgraded to Python 3.11, which ensured full compatibility and error-free execution of all dependencies.

The attached requirements.txt file reflects the working package versions for Python 3.11.
To avoid any runtime errors, please set up your environment using Python 3.11, not 3.13 or higher.

Also, in the raw folder you can find the initial raw data we used for the project. Make sure use either raw folder or panel_data csv
when running the scripts, any way using raw folder and Data extraction script, they give you the panel.

Thank you!
